# GeospatialProgrammingPractice
This is a repository to house my work focused on geospatial programming.

Much of my practice is based upon the Geospatial Analysis with Python and R course put together by Alexander Kmoch and Evelyn Uuemaa.

This course can be found here: https://kodu.ut.ee/~kmoch/geopython2018/index.html#
